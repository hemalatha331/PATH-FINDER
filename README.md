## 📌 Project Overview
This Python script demonstrates graph visualization and pathfinding using the NetworkX library. It constructs a graph with nodes and weighted edges, finds the shortest path between locations, and visualizes the graph with highlighted paths over a background image.

## 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Requests

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install networkx matplotlib requests

🔹 Functionality

Pathfinding Options:

Source-Destination Input: Enter a start and end location to find the shortest path.

Source-Weight Input: Enter a start location and a maximum weight (e.g., distance, time) to find all reachable paths within that limit.

The script uses Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path calculations.

The graph is visually represented, and shortest paths are highlighted.

📍 Real-World Example

Imagine a company with multiple branches across the country. An inspection team needs to visit various branches efficiently:

Instead of taking longer routes, they can input their Source and Destination to get the shortest path.

If they have a specific Distance or Time Limit, they can input the source and the limit to see available paths within the constraint.

This system optimizes travel routes, saving time and resources.

✨ A practical solution for optimizing travel routes using graph algorithms! ✨
